## Bugs

### Add Review and Edit Review 
  - Whilst testing user stories, I realized the user is able to amend the product_model name, which would lead to review added not matching any products and only appearing on the user profile page. 
  - I have fixed it by including `readonly="readonly"` attribut to the **input** element.
